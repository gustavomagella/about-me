# about-me

🇬🇧 `<en-us>`

Hi There, I'm**Gustavo Magella** and I'm glad to see you here! :😎:

Working as :☁️: **Cloud Security Architect** (@IBM) )and :🔐: **Cybersecurity Specialist** with +15 years of experience.

In the span of 15+ years of career, I've had the chance to dive into some really cool projects around the world and have seen the tech community from many angles, including a 7-year stint as a Microsoft Student Partner and now 6 as a Microsoft MVP - loving every minute of it! (**#MVPBuzz**)

I'm a teacher, writer (coming soon) and "frustrated" musician (Search for Johnny Castaway on Spotify, Deezer or Youtube – hahaha).

I consider myself a "maker", "thinker", a restless mind that is always searching for "How ALL the things are working?" and trying to thinking outside the box most of the times. :🤓::🤯::🤩:

So, that's it! Keep in touch, and stay safe! :🤟🏼::🌹::😘:

**_Gustavo Magella (Gus)_**
